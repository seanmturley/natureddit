# Natureddit

> A read-only client for [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com), featuring a home page dedicated to nature photography.

## Introduction

Natureddit will function as a read-only client for [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com), featuring a home page dedicated to nature photography with posts pulled from a curated list of subreddits.

The app will present posts in a card layout that emphasises images, as a way to showcase nature photographs.

A search bar will provide access to other Reddit content (posts and subreddits).
